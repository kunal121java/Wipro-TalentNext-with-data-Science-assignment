# Problem Statement:
# You are given three strings as command line arguments, separated by space. 
# Each string contains numbers separated by hyphens ('-'). 
# - The first string contains the numbers you like.
# - The second string contains the numbers you dislike.
# - The third string contains the numbers given to you.
#
# Your initial happiness is 0.
# For each number in the third string:
#   - If the number is present in your like list (string 1), add 1 to happiness.
#   - If the number is present in your dislike list (string 2), subtract 1 from happiness.
#   - If the number is not present in either, happiness remains unchanged.
# Output your final happiness.
