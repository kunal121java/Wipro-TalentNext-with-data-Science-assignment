# Problem Statement:
# Write a Python function that accepts a hyphen-separated sequence of colors as input 
# and returns the colors in a hyphen-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
# Constraint: All the colors will be completely in either lower case or upper case.

def sort_colors(color_sequence):
    """
    Accepts a hyphen-separated string of colors and returns 
    a hyphen-separated string with colors sorted alphabetically.
    
    Parameters:
        color_sequence (str): Hyphen-separated colors (all upper or all lower case)
    
    Returns:
        str: Hyphen-separated, alphabetically sorted colors
    """
    # Split the input string into a list by hyphens

# Sample usage:
input1 = "green-red-yellow-black-white"
print(sort_colors(input1))   # Output: black-green-red-white-yellow
